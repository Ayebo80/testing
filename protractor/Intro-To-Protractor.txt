What is Protractor?
End-to-End					Unit Testing
- Interact with the entire application stack	- Interact with a single, isolated unit at a time
- Focused on what the user experiences		- Focused on the functionality of the code
- Runs in a browser				- Runs in the console

Test Framework for AngularJS Applications
+ Wait for Angular
Example: Bring up new page in Angular & make HTTP-Request out to an API
=> Protractor can monitor that Request & know that Angular will not be ready to display that data untill Request comes back
+ Get elements by bindings
=> Protractor knows that its a binding
+ Get elements by repeaters
=> Protractor can get into Repeaters(ng-repeat), it knows about ng-model & ng-repeat

Why Use Protractor
Test/Think Like a User
- Actions are rarely stand alone
- A user only has access too what is displayed
=> User sees that data is not displayed, Dev only sees that data in DB has changed
- Systems have many different personas
To improve test efficiency
Develop Feature -> Test Feature -> Integrate Feature -> Test Previous Features(don't break other features) -> Release
Cycle of Tests
- Have to make sure it works
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Happy-Path => Enter all the Right-Data
Weird-Data => Click buttons that should not be clicked yet, we enter a name thats too long, forget to put in zip-code
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
- Benefit of the doubt
There might be side effects with another feature (my code breaks others code)
- So many features to test
Overwhelming, because features grow with software

Pain Points
- Repetitive
Keep testing the same feature, we enter a name thats too long, forget to put in zip-code

Protractor
- Doesn't mind repetition
- Always remembers to check everything
- Runs while you're working
